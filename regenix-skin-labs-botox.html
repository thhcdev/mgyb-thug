<h3><strong><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">What Is Botox and How Does It Work?</span></strong></h3>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">Botox isn&rsquo;t some mysterious magic, it&rsquo;s science-backed, proven, and FDA-approved. Essentially, Botox is a purified protein that temporarily relaxes the muscles that cause wrinkles. By targeting specific areas like crow&rsquo;s feet, forehead lines, and frown lines, Botox smooths out your skin for a younger, refreshed look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">Botox is like hitting the &ldquo;pause&rdquo; button on aging. Those lines that make you look tired or stressed? Gone. The best part? It&rsquo;s quick, and virtually painless, and you can get back to your busy day right after.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

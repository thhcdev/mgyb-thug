<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">What Is Dyslexia, and How Does It Affect Learning?</span></strong></h3>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Let&rsquo;s start with the basics. Dyslexia isn&rsquo;t just about mixing up letters. It&rsquo;s a learning difference that makes reading, writing, and spelling tougher for kids and even adults. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Think of it like this: your brain&rsquo;s wired a little differently, making it harder to match letters to sounds or sounds to words. But hey, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re not smart, it just means you learn differently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In a classroom, a student with dyslexia might feel like they&rsquo;re running a race where everyone else has a head start. It&rsquo;s frustrating, right? They could struggle with reading aloud, understanding what they&rsquo;ve read, or even writing down their thoughts. But with the right help, those hurdles can become stepping stones.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Signs Your Child Might Have Dyslexia</span></strong></h3>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">How do you know if dyslexia might be the culprit? Here are some common signs:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Trouble recognizing letters or words.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Avoiding reading out loud or writing tasks.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Mixing up words or letters, like saying &ldquo;b&rdquo; for &ldquo;d.&rdquo;</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Struggling to follow a sequence, like days of the week or instructions.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Feeling discouraged or anxious about school.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Sound familiar? If so, it&rsquo;s time to consider professional evaluation and support.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><strong>Why Early Intervention Matters?</strong></span></h3>
